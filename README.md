# Unity-Rider-Template

The Game itself doesnt work so the only thing i can show is what the scripts does

The assignment is in the "Platformet" (i have dyslexia and cant spell and didnt want to fix) Folder and in the assets folder in "sCRIPTS" is all the scripts.

You can ignore "DesignPatterns" folder as i didnt end up using it.

info of layout:
Script name - what patern i think/know it is (i do feel that i need to use it more to know) , usecase.

SCRIPS:

CameraCon - (Dependency Injection) (Modular), camera folows the player smopothly (taken from anoter project.

Inventory - (Singleton) (Obsesrver) , the inventory for items.

InventorySlot - (connection to singleton), handles the inventory slot.

InventoryUI - (Dependency Injection) , its the manager for the inventory UI.

Item - (Prototype(?)), the blueprint for items.

ItemPickup - (?) ,WIP its for piking up items but i havent made it work. 

Player - (dependencie(?)), it moving the player taken from same project as "CameraCon" WIP. 

Potion - (null), WIP.

Store - (null), WIP.

interactible - (?), its a work in progress.

After Word:
I did start on this project to late as i just did evverything seperate instead of trying to use the assignments from the lessons in the project. not really happy with it tho i will work on the inventory and store as that was my goal.
